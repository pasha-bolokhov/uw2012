	Two-dimensional models have interesting similarities to 4-d gauge theories
\vspace{0.4cm}

	CP$^{N-1}$ theory has been shown to have chiral symmetry breaking, mass gap,
	asymptotic freedom, {\it etc} and all these properties are much easier to show
	in two dimensions 
\vspace{0.4cm}

	In general, two-dimensional theories are simpler and two-dimensional methods
	are more powerful

	There is also a two-dimensional --- four-dimensional duality of their BPS spectra

\begin{frame}{Exact superpotential}

	The theory possesses an ``exact'' superpotential of
	Veneziano-Yankielowicz type
\[

\begin{frame}{Mirror dual of CP$^{N-1}$}

	The mirror dual is the affine Toda theory

	The vacuum values coincide with $ \W_\text{eff}(\sigma_p) $ upon
	identification
\[
